# Smart-Traffic-Junction

This repository contains the working implementation of the paper [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01770). A simple algorithm for traffic density estimation using image processing and machine learning.

## Dataset

The dataset was created using <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~sgg/QMUL_Junction_Datasets/Junction2/Junction2.html">QMUL junction 2</a> video. We manually sorted the rois of the <a href="dataset.zip">dataset</a>.

## Files
1) save_rois.py : saves ROIs (small blocks of image) from the QMUL junction 2 video <br>
2) save_HOG_LBP.py : saves the HOG(Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and LBP(Local Binary Pattern) features into pickle file
3) classifier.py : trains the SVM classifier and saves the model into pickle
4) predictor.py : reads the video and predicts the output on the image
